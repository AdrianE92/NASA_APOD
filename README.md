# NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day

## How to run

This project does not contain the nasa_key.js  
If you want to generate your own key, you can get one for free at [api.nasa.gov](api.nasa.gov)  
You can also run the project with `KEY = "DEMO_KEY"`, though this has some limitations.  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
